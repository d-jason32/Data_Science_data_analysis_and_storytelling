# What question are you exploring? 
Is there a correlation between what state you live in and a persons depression rate? 

# What did you find? 
In dataset 1 lowest is around 13% - 15%. The lowest are Hawaii, New Jersey, New York, California, Maryland. The highest are Tennessee, Kentucky, West Virginia, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Alabama. 

In dataset 2 it also agrees with dataset 1 tht the highest depression rates are in the south and appalachia. Also, the same lowest states are present as dataset 1. 

The highest states are in the south and appalachian and they have lower incomes, higher poverty rates and higher unemployment. They also have less access to mental health care with longer distances to travel to clinics. They also have higher rates of chronic illness like diabetes, heart disease, chronic pain and obesity.
