# Data Science : Data Analysis and Storytelling

## Jason, Nadir, Anthony, Derrick

Your project should include data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and statistical analysis that lead to a clear, visual story.

    Clean and preprocess your data (handle missing values, outliers, formatting, etc.).

    Conduct exploratory and statistical analyses to uncover meaningful patterns or relationships.

    Use appropriate visualizations (charts, graphs, maps, etc.) to support your findings.

    Tell a coherent and compelling story: What question are you exploring? What did you find? Why does it matter?

# What question are you exploring? 

The question we exploring is is there a correlation between depression rate and the state you live in.
# What did you find? 


# Why does it matter?
