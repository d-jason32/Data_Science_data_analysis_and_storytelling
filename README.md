# What question are you exploring? 
Is there a correlation between what state you live in and a persons depression rate? 

# What did you find? 
In dataset 1 lowest is around 13% - 15%. The lowest are Hawaii, New Jersey, New York, California, Maryland. The highest are Tennessee, Kentucky, West Virginia, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Alabama. 

In dataset 2 it also agrees with dataset 1 tht the highest depression rates are in the south and appalachia. Also, the same lowest states are present as dataset 1. 

The highest states are in the south and appalachian and they have lower incomes, higher poverty rates and higher unemployment. They also have less access to mental health care with longer distances to travel to clinics. They also have higher rates of chronic illness like diabetes, heart disease, chronic pain and obesity. 

# Why does it matter?

Identifying the rates of depression could be vital to understanding how large scale environmental factors can contribute to a person's mental health. It must be explored how their mental health could contribute to their behaviors and their likelihood to do either positive or negative things. Gathering and understanding the data is a powerful tool that would allow us as a society to send more resources to areas with high rates of depression and that would help those suffering from depression. It would also allow us to study how making those changes to the environment and those large scale factors effect the states with the highest rates of depression. Investing in the infrastructure of those states and even changing the current infrastructure would likely allow for those who are depressed to become better.
